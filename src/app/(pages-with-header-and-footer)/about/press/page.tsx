          Back in the day, hacking was a thing of the past. It was a time when
          people would use their computer skills to break into other people's
          computers and steal information. But now, with the advent of the hacking
          its not so easy anymore. The hackers have become more sophisticated and
          they are using new techniques to break into your computer. They are
          using social engineering techniques to trick you into giving them your
          password or other sensitive information. They are also using
          sophisticated software to break into your computer and steal your
          information. So, if you want to protect yourself from hackers, you
          should use a strong password and use a good antivirus software.
