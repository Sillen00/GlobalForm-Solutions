# GlobalForm-Solutions

GlobalForm-Solutions is a collaborative project undertaken by three classmates as part of our final thesis. The project focuses on building a web application that allows users to create forms and share them with friends or events. We have utilized the Next.js framework with the T3 stack to set up the project.
